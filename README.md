# File Browser

An integrated, keyboard driven file selector for VS Code, inspired by Emacs's
[Helm](https://emacs-helm.github.io/helm/) file selector.

## Features

This is what this extension gives you:

-   A fully keyboard driven file open dialog: bind `file-browser.open` to `Ctrl+O` (or `C-x C-f` if
    you're an Emacs expat) and enjoy the lack of OS file dialog clutter.
-   Start typing a file name to quickly find it in the current folder.
-   Automatically create files and folders just by typing their names and selecting the option that
    appears.
-   Easy navigation in and out of folders by using the left and right arrow keys.
-   Navigate to your home folder by typing `~/` into the search box.
-   Perform file operations like rename and delete by stepping into a file with the right arrow key,
    or by hitting "Ctrl+A" on any file or folder.
